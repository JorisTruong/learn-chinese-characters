# Learn Chinese Characters

Hosted on https://learn-chinese-characters.surge.sh

#### Welcome to Learn Chinese Characters!

The goal of this website is to learn Chinese characters, especially how to write them based on stroke order. It is heavily focused on writing, but also contains data about pronunciation. This project is meant to be collaborative and not Mandarin only. Feel free to submit pronunciations on your own Chinese dialect, so that people can learn more about your dialect!

This website has been developed in React with the Ant Design library and the Gatsby framework.
